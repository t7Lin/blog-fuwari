>*lf you can **keep** your **head** when **all about** <font color =#70DB93>you</font>
Are losing theirs and blaming it on <font color =#70DB93>you</font>;
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt <font color =#70DB93>you</font>,
But make <font color =#B5A642>allowance</font> for their <font color =#B5A642>doubting</font> <font color =#70DB93>too</font>;
If you can <font color =#B5A642>wait</font> and not be tired by <font color =#70DB93>waiting</font>,
Or, <font color = #FF7F00>being</font> lied about, <font color = #FF7F00>don't</font> deal in <font color =#70DB93>lies</font>,
Or, <font color = #FF7F00>being</font> <font color =#B5A642>hated</font>, <font color = #FF7F00>don't</font> <font color =#B5A642>give</font> way to <font color =#70DB93>hating</font>,
And yet <font color = #FF7F00>don't</font> look too good, nor talk too <font color =#70DB93>wise</font>.*
