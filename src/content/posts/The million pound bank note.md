1.题目：The million pound bank note；

2.内容：

Roderick: How well do you know London?

Henry: Not at all. It’s my first trip here.

Roderick: I wonder, Mr Adams, if you’d mind us asking you a few questions.

Henry: Not at all. Go right ahead.

Roderick: May we ask what you’re doing in this city and what your plans are?

Henry: Well, I can’t say that I have any plans. I’m hoping to find work. As a matter of fact, I landed in Britain by accident.

Oliver: How is that possible?

Henry: Well, you see, back home I had my own boat. About a month ago, I was sailing out of the bay...(his eyes stare at what is left of the brothers’ dinner on the table)

Oliver: Well, go on.

Henry: Oh, yes. Well, towards nightfall I found myself carried out to sea by a strong wind. It was all my fault I didn’t know whether I could survive until morning. The next morning I’d just about given myself up for lost when I was spotted by a ship.

Oliver: And it was the ship that brought you to England.

Henry: Yes, the fact is that I earned my passage by working as an unpaid hand, which accounts for my appearance. I went to the American embassy to seek help, but...( the brothers smile at each other.)

Roderick: Well, you mustn’t worry about that. It’s an advantage.

Henry: I’m afraid I don’t follow you, sir.
