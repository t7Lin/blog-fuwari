On a typical day, we **spend** our time **cheering** up patients, their family, and more often than not, the hospital staff, too! We do this **by doing** magic tricks, **singing** songs, **telling** stories and, of course **telling** silly jokes. Some children, though, don't feel **like laughing**, especially if they're in pain. We have to be very sensitive and work closely with the doctors and nurses, who keep us updated on each patient.
