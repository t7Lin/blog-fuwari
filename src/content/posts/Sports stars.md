Venus and Serena Williams are sisters. They are also both tennis champions who often have to play each other! Venus is ==now== eleventh in the world, and her younger sister Serena has moved up to third．

The two sisters were born in a poor and dangerous area of California．It was full of drugs and violence. ==In a recent interview,== Venus spoke about the time when she and Serena were practicing tennis and they had to run and hide as bullets started flying through the air. ==Finally, in 1991==, the sisters and their family moved to a safer area and since then they have never looked back．

The sisters’ father, Richard, started to train Venus and Serena when they were young children. He has been very strict with his daughters, training them hard to compete against each other. Brandi, the sisters’ mother, taught her daughters at home so that they completed their high school while developing their tennis careers. ==Today,== both sisters are studying design at college. They have already expressed a keen interest in working in design after their tennis careers come to an end．
