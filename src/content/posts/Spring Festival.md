lt was my first time spending Spring Festival in China with my host family,Spring Festival is highly valued by every Chinese family. Preparations began a week before the festival. First, the house was cleaned from top to bottom. My host mother Mrs. Chen said this was to sweep away the dirt of the past year and get ready for the new year. Next, the Chinese character Fu was attached upside down to our front door. lt is believed that when Fu is put upside down,happiness arrives. The character looked really cool.
