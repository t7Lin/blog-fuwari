There are two kinds of voices: the inner voice and the outer voice. You inner voice expresses your personal opinions, while the outer voice tells you about opinions from what you hear or read. Although your inner voice can be useful, it can also get in the way of learning. lf you keep paying too much attention to it, you risk missing important information.Instead, active learners are open - minded and focus on what the speaker/writer is saying, not on what their brain is saying in the background. In this way, they are in a better position to make decisions.
