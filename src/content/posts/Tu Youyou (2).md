>This was not an easy task. <font color =#FF2400>The reason why</font> this was difficult was that the team had limited resources. They did not have enough staff, and <font color =#FF2400>the laboratory in which</font> they worked had poor air quality. However, after hundreds of failed experiments, they eventually came across a promising chemical.
Tu Youyou bravely volunteered to be the first human subject, and the rest of her team followed her. The test was a success. <font color =#FF2400>The medicine they discovered</font>, artemisinin, has now become the world's most effective drug for fighting malaria.
