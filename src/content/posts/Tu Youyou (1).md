>*The efforts of Tu and her team finally **paid off**. In November 1972, through **trial and error**, they successfully discovered qinghaosu - the most effective **part of** the qinghao extract. As a key part of many malaria medicines, qinghaosu has since benefited about 200 million malaria patients. More than 40 years after its discovery, Tu was eventually awarded a Nobel Prize for her work. In her Nobel Lecture, she encouraged scientists to further explore the treasure house of traditional Chinese medicine and **raise it to a higher level***
