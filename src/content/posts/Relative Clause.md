## Definition

A type of dependent clause that provides extra information 
about a noun in the main clause.
## Function

They serve as an adjective to modify the noun. That's why 
they are also called **adjective clause**.
# Features

Usually, they come after the noun they modify. Basic
relative clauses begin with a **relative pronoun**, such 
as **that**,**which**,**who**,**whom**,**whose**,**when**,**where**,**why**,
or **prep+which**.

- **that** used in restrictive relative clause
  **which** used in non-restrictive relative clause

## Main types
### Restrictive relative clause

Provides **essential information** about the noun.

### Non-restrictive relative clause

Provides **non-essential information** about the noun.

### Reduced relative clauses

**Reduce**: Remove the relative **pronoun** and **linking verb**.

**Reduce if:** 
- 1.The relative clause uses **a relative pronoun+progressive
  verb/passive form/adjective/prepositional phrase** 
- 2.The relative pronoun functions as the **object** of the clause.

#### Examples
- 1.This <font color =#238E68>marker</font>,<font color = #FF0000>which is bought by my company</font>,is red.
  
- 2.The <font color =#238E68>computer</font> <font color = #FF0000>that he bought online</font> is fast.
  
- 3.The <font color =#238E68>computer</font><font color = #FF0000> that he bought at a second-hand shop</font> is slow.
  
- 4.The <font color =#238E68>guy</font> <font color = #FF0000>(who is) talking to the teacher</font> is my roommate.
  
- 5.This is the <font color =#238E68>book</font> <font color = #FF0000>(that) you recomended</font>.
  
- 6.Which of these <font color =#238E68>drinks</font> <font color = #FF0000>(that are on the table)</font> is yours?
  
- 7.Did <font color =#238E68>everyone</font> <font color = #FF0000>who took the trip</font> get sick?
  
- 8.This is the <font color =#238E68>place</font> <font color = #FF0000>(where) we first met</font>.
  
- 9.Do you remember the <font color =#238E68>time</font> <font color = #FF0000>(when) we met on a family trip to Europe</font>?

## Tips of identifying relative clause

- 1. **punctuation**: Restrictive relative clauses sometimes
  have **commas** around them.
  
- 2.A **phrase** that begins with a relative pronoun.
  
- 3.A phrase that follows a noun and gives **extra information**. 
  
- 4.If we remove the relative clauses the whole sentence is
  still grammatically correct.
