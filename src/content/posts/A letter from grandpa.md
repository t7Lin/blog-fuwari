1. 题目：**A letter from grandpa**；

2. 内容：

Dear Lucy

A healthy diet and lifestyle are very important. First of all, Daniel should stay away from food containing a lot of sugar. He should also get out of the habit of having snacks late at night and keep away from soft drinks. I also think that Daniel should break the habit of sleeping until noon at the weekend. He used to wake up early at the weekend and play football, but he no longer does. He would feel much better if he started exercising again.

Take care of yourself. I hope to see you soon.

Love

Grandpa
