1.题目：British and American English；

2.内容：

British and American English are different in many ways. The first and most obvious way is in the vocabulary. There are hundreds of different words which are not used on the other side of the Atlantic, or which are used with a different meaning. Some of these words are well known—Americans drive automobiles down freeways and fill up with gas; the British drive cars along motorways and fill up with petrol. As a **good tourist**, you will **need to use** the underground in London or the subway in New York, or maybe you will prefer to get around the town by taxi (British) or cab (American).
